# Gameboy Emulator

This is my attempt at creating a Gameboy emulator in Rust.

The main goals of this project are to:
- Learn Rust
- Become comfortable with bitwise operations
- Learn to write unit tests
- Gain an understanding of how computer hardware functions
- And finally of course, be able to play a game on the emulator :D
    - Tetris first, then hopefully work towards Pokemon

## Status

I am currently working on implementing the CPU.
The current goal is to implement the instructions required to load a bootrom.
Once the instructions are implemented I will work on the PPU (Picture Processing Unit) to be able to display an image.
